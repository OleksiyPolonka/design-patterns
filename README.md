# Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns to help you understand what they are and how you can use them. Design patterns enhance your code architecture, making it more flexible, scalable, and maintainable. Design patterns offer time-tested solutions to common software design challenges.



## Design Patterns Included
The implementations in this repository are organized into three main categories:

Creational Patterns
> Examples: Singleton, Factory, Prototype.

Structural Patterns
> Examples: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy.

Behavioral Patterns
> Examples: Observer, Strategy, State, Template Method.

## Usage
To run and explore a design pattern example:

1. **Navigate to the repository root:** Ensure you're in the root directory of the repository.

2. **Run the development command:** Execute the following command in your terminal: ```npm run dev```
3. ***Select a design pattern to study:*** Open the file ```/src/index.ts``` and uncomment the design pattern that interests you. Study its implementation and observe how it works in practice.
